# 1.2 Customizing the environment

Video editing is a labor-intensive process. During the course of a working day, you probably cut, trim, move, preview, ... strips hundreds of time. Having a customized working environment that is tailored to your needs can save you a lot of time during the editing process.

Blender has a dedicated workspace environment for video editing. But, of course in the tradition of a truly open-source package, you can customize this completely. From rearranging windows to reassigning short-cut keys.

Another benefit of the open-source culture is the existence of a huge contributing community. Lots of addons are created for specific use-cases Other add-ons fill in the still missing parts of the core Video Sequencer.
