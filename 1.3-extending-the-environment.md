# 1.3 Extending the environment

Blender's Video Sequencer is a fairly good editor but, nevertheless, it lacks some \(vital\) components. For example, sound editing is for the most part neglected. Sound level monitoring, normalizing sound level, can easily be done in an open-source package as Audacity. So, there is an add-on to export your sound data to Audacity and importing it back.

Tin2Tin has compiled a webpage on [Blenderartists.org](https://blenderartists.org/t/video-sequence-editor-news-add-ons/1188770) with more than 100 links to add-ons. They fit into categories such as toolboxes, \(multi-threaded\) export and import, effects, strip editing, generate, audio, scene strips, markers, organization, Multicam, user interface, shortcut keys, and templates.

The working environment can also be heavily extended/improved by the use of proxies. A proxy is a low-resolution video file that can take the place of a larger-resolution video file in your timeline. This way you can edit faster; while the render can use the high-resolution files.
