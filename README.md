This is the homepage for the refactoring attempt of the Blender Video Sequencer Editor \(VSE\) Documentation. The VSE \(LTS version 2.93\) has lately undergone some drastic changes. The time seems ripe to also refactor the documentation.

There are two methods for editing video within Blender: the Compositor and the Video Sequence Editor \(VSE\). This manual describes primarily the VSE, sometimes shortened to “Sequencer”. The VSE is a complete video editing system that allows you to combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. The strength of Blender's VSE is that it can be combined with the 2D \(Grease Pencil\) and 3D modeling components and the animation and scripting module.

&lt;TODO&gt; Here about an image that outlines the different components of Blender and their relationships. The reader should have a basic understanding of how the VSE fits in. &lt;/TODO&gt;

This documentation follows a workflow-oriented approach. How you edit video in practice, which steps you take and how you split-up a real-life project is a guide for the structure of these docs.

We differentiate between three broad stages in video editing. \(1\) Set up your project \(2\) Edit your project \(3\) Render your project. The following mindmap documents the complete process.

&lt;TODO&gt; Here about a mindmap of the complete manual; up to Table of Content level 3 &lt;/TODO&gt;
