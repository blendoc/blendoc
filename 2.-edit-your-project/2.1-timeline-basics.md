# 2.1 Timeline basics

The timeline, also known as the Sequencer, contains a heading with the time indication, two optional side panels, a play head, and a strip area. You can switch the editor display type between Sequencer and Preview with the Toggle Sequencer/Preview command or the `Ctrl-Tab` shortcut.

You can show or hide the Sidebar with the shortcut `N`. The Toolbar can be shown or hidden with the shortcut `T`.

The play head is the blue vertical line with the current frame number at the top. It can be set or moved to a new position by pressing or holding LMB in scrubbing area at the top of the timeline. You can move the play head in increments by pressing Left or Right, or by using Alt-Wheel. You can also jump to the beginning or end frame by pressing Shift-Left or Shift-Right. As you do, the image for that frame is displayed in the Preview region.

When you drag the frame indicator with Shift-RMB directly on a sequence strip, this will show the strip solo, \(temporarily disregarding effects and other strips, showing only this strip’s output\) and the strip will be highlighted. When holding Ctrl while dragging it will snap to the start and endpoints of strips.

Real-time preview is possible on reasonable computers when viewing an image sequence or movie \(avi/mov\) file. Scene strips can use viewport previews or proxies for real-time playback, otherwise displaying rendered frame is supported, but typically too slow for real-time playback. Every other synced editor can be used for scrubbing e.g. the Timeline.

With the menu View &gt; Show Seconds or `Ctrl-T` you can toggle between a timeline with frames or time \( SMPTPE-code\) as a unit.

Overlays are information that is displayed on top of the strip region. There is a switch to turn off/on all overlays for the strip region. You can show the Name on the strip \(Name\), the path to the strip file on the strip \(Source\), the length of the strip in frames \(Duration\), the overflow bars of “extra” content from either cutting or sliding strips \(Offsets\), and the animation curves for opacity and volume values as darkened sections of the strip \(F-Curves\).

There is also an option to display the waveform of a sound strip. It could be turned Off or On for all strips. The Use Strip Option sets the waveform per strip configured with Display Waveform.
